## Archived Features

This folder stores disabled features that are intentionally excluded from the active mobile app build.

- `healthkit-v2/`: previous Apple Health integration implementation.
- `plugins/withHealthKit.js`: previous Expo config plugin for HealthKit entitlements.

The active app runtime and `tsconfig` exclude this folder.
