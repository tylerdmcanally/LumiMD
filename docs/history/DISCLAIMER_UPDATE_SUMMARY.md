## 🎯 **Example: Before & After**

### **BEFORE (Too Directive ❌)**
```
⚠️ Medication Safety Alert

CRITICAL: Metoprolol + Carvedilol

Taking two beta-blockers is dangerous.

What to do:
Stop taking Metoprolol immediately. Contact your 
provider today.
```

### **AFTER (Compliant ✅)**
```
ℹ️ Medication Information

⚠️ NOT MEDICAL ADVICE: This is educational information only. 
Always consult your healthcare provider before starting, 
stopping, or changing any medication.

HIGH PRIORITY: Metoprolol + Carvedilol
Both are Beta-Blockers

Medical literature indicates both medications are in the 
Beta-Blockers class. Taking two medications from the same 
class is generally not recommended.

Consider:
Consider discussing this with your healthcare provider before 
starting Carvedilol. Your provider can advise whether to 
adjust Metoprolol or your treatment plan.
