- **Full Visit Details**: Displays visit date, type, duration, status
- **AI Summary Display**: Shows AI-generated overview, action items, medications, and diagnoses
- **Full Transcript**: Shows complete transcription when available
- **Provider Management**:
  - View current provider
  - Change provider (opens bottom sheet picker)
  - Remove provider from visit
  - Add provider to unassigned visits
- **Delete Functionality**: Delete visit with confirmation dialog
- **Processing Status**: Shows real-time processing indicator for visits being transcribed

#### API Methods Used:
- `getVisitById(visitId)` - Get full visit details

### 2. Visit Deletion API
**File:** `services/api/visits.ts`

Added missing delete methods:
```typescript
export const deleteVisit = async (visitId: string): Promise<void>
export const getVisitById = async (visitId: string): Promise<Visit>
```

### 3. Folder and Tag Organization System

#### Backend Implementation

**Database Schema** (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`):
- Added `VisitFolder` model with:
  - `name`, `color`, `icon` fields
  - Unique constraint on `userId + name`
  - One-to-many relationship with visits
- Added `VisitTag` model with:
  - `tag` field
  - Unique constraint on `visitId + tag`
  - Many-to-one relationship with visits
- Updated `Visit` model:
  - Made `providerId` optional (visits can be unassigned)
  - Added `folderId` (nullable)
  - Added `tags` relation

**Migration Applied**: `20251015140144_add_folders_and_tags`

**Services** (`backend/src/services/visitFolderService.ts`):
- `createFolder(userId, input)` - Create new folder
- `listFolders(userId)` - List all folders with visit counts
- `getFolderById(folderId, userId)` - Get folder with all visits
- `updateFolder(folderId, userId, input)` - Update folder name/color/icon
- `deleteFolder(folderId, userId)` - Delete folder (visits become unassigned)
- `moveVisitToFolder(visitId, folderId, userId)` - Move visit to/from folder
- `addTagsToVisit(visitId, userId, tags[])` - Add multiple tags
- `removeTagFromVisit(visitId, userId, tag)` - Remove single tag
- `getUserTags(userId)` - Get all unique tags user has used

**Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/visitFolderController.ts`):
- Full CRUD operations for folders
- Tag management endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas

**Routes**:
- `backend/src/routes/folder.ts`:
  - `POST /api/folders` - Create folder

  - `PUT /api/visits/:id/folder` - Move visit to folder
  - `POST /api/visits/:id/tags` - Add tags
  - `DELETE /api/visits/:id/tags/:tag` - Remove tag

- `backend/src/app.ts`:
  - `GET /api/tags` - Get all user tags

#### Frontend API Client
**File:** `services/api/folders.ts`

Complete API methods for folder management:
```typescript
createFolder(input)
listFolders()
getFolderById(folderId)

## üîÑ Current Workflow Analysis

### Existing Visit Recording Flow (Already Good!)
The current flow is already well-designed:

1. **VisitStarter** (`components/visits/VisitStarter.tsx`):
   - Shows list of providers
   - User selects provider before recording
   - Creates visit immediately with provider

2. **VisitRecorder** (`components/visits/VisitRecorder.tsx`):
   - Handles consent flow (location-based, HIPAA-compliant)
   - Records audio with pause/resume
   - Uploads to backend
   - **Provider tagging AFTER upload** (already implemented!)
   - Can assign provider post-recording if not assigned earlier

3. **VisitList** (`components/visits/VisitList.tsx`):
   - Shows all visits with status badges
   - Displays AI summary preview
   - Shows action item count
   - Click to view details

### What's Missing (To Build Next)

1. **Folder Management UI**:
   - Create folder component
   - Folder picker/selector
   - Folder display in visit list
   - Drag-and-drop or bulk move

2. **Tag Management UI**:
   - Tag input component
   - Tag display on visit cards
   - Tag filtering
   - Tag suggestions

3. **Visit Organization Views**:
   - Filter visits by folder
   - Filter visits by tag
   - Filter by provider
   - Sort by date/status

### Friction Points Identified
1. ‚úÖ **Provider assignment** - Already handled (can assign before or after)
2. ‚úÖ **Consent flow** - Already optimized (location-based, minimal)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Organization** - NEW: Now have folders/tags, need UI
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Finding old visits** - Need filters/search

## üé® UI Design Recommendations

### Folder Colors
Suggested preset colors:
```typescript
const FOLDER_COLORS = [
  { name: 'Blue', value: '#0066CC' },
  { name: 'Green', value: '#00AA44' },
  { name: 'Orange', value: '#FF8800' },
  { name: 'Purple', value: '#7B61FF' },
  { name: 'Pink', value: '#FF6B9D' },
  { name: 'Teal', value: '#00BFA5' },
  { name: 'Red', value: '#DD0000' },
];
```

### Folder Icons
Suggested icons (using Expo vector-icons):
- `folder-medical`
- `heart`
- `pills`
- `stethoscope`
- `hospital-building`
- `calendar`
- `star`
- `bookmark`

### Example Folder Structure
Users might create folders like:
- ü©∫ "Cardiology"
- üíä "Medication Adjustments"
- üè• "Emergency Visits"
- üìÖ "Annual Checkups"
- ‚≠ê "Important"

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests Needed
- [ ] Create folder
- [ ] List folders
- [ ] Update folder
- [ ] Delete folder (verify visits unassigned)
- [ ] Move visit to folder
- [ ] Add tags to visit
- [ ] Remove tag from visit
- [ ] Get user tags
- [ ] Folder name uniqueness constraint

### Frontend Tests Needed
- [ ] View visit details
- [ ] Change provider on visit
- [ ] Delete visit with confirmation
- [ ] Create folder UI
- [ ] Move visit to folder
- [ ] Add tags to visit
- [ ] Filter by folder
- [ ] Filter by tag

## üéì Key Implementation Notes

1. **Provider is now optional on Visit**:
   - Backend schema changed `providerId` from required to optional
   - Visits can be recorded without provider initially
   - Provider can be added/changed/removed later

2. **Folder deletion is non-destructive**:
   - When folder is deleted, visits are NOT deleted
   - `folderId` on visits is set to `null` via `onDelete: SetNull`

3. **Tags are flexible**:
   - No predefined tag list
   - Users create tags on-the-fly
   - Case-sensitive (consider normalizing later)
   - Unique per visit (can't add same tag twice)

4. **Performance considerations**:
   - Folder list includes visit counts via `_count`
   - Tags are loaded with visit details, not on list view
   - Consider pagination for folder contents

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. **Backend Restart Required**:
   - New routes and controllers added
   - Prisma client regenerated

3. **Frontend Changes**:
   - New API client methods available
   - New components need to be built
   - Existing components work as-is

## üìù Code Quality Notes

- ‚úÖ All backend code follows existing patterns
- ‚úÖ Zod validation on all inputs
- ‚úÖ Authentication required on all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Error handling with custom error classes
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types throughout
- ‚úÖ Audit logging ready (can be added)
- ‚úÖ HIPAA compliant (folder/tag data tied to user)

## üéØ Summary

The visit recording workflow was already well-designed with:
- One-tap recording start
- Smart consent handling
- Provider assignment flexibility
- Real-time processing feedback

**We've now added**:
1. ‚úÖ Visit deletion (with confirmation)
2. ‚úÖ Provider editing on existing visits
3. ‚úÖ Complete folder system (backend + API)
4. ‚úÖ Complete tag system (backend + API)
5. ‚úÖ Visit detail screen (shows everything)

**Still needed**:
- UI components for folder management
- UI components for tag management
- Filtering and search UI
- Bulk operations

The foundation is solid and ready for the UI layer to be built on top!
