## 📊 **Example: Beta-Blocker Duplication**

### **Information Provided:**
```
Medical literature indicates both medications are in the 
Beta-Blockers class. Taking two medications from the same 
class is generally not recommended.

Consider:
Consider discussing this with your healthcare provider before 
starting Carvedilol. Your provider can advise whether to 
adjust Metoprolol or your treatment plan.

⚠️ This is informational only and not medical advice.
