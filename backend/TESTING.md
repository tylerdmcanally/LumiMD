# LumiMD Backend Testing Guide

## Testing Approaches

### 0. Unit Test Suite âœ…

Run the Jest-powered unit suite (no external services required):

```bash
npm test
```

Current coverage focuses on security-sensitive helpers (encryption utilities, JWT helpers) plus service-level auth and provider flows (register/login/refresh, provider CRUD/delete guardrails).

#### Continuous Integration

Every push and pull request triggers `npm test -- --runInBand` via `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml`, so keep the suite green before opening PRs.

### 1. Automated Test Scripts âœ…

We have comprehensive test scripts that validate all functionality:

#### Test All New Features
```bash
./test-new-features.sh
```
Tests: User Profile, Medical Profile, Action Items, Trusted Access

#### Test Complete Workflow
```bash
./test-full-workflow.sh
```
Tests: Auth â†’ Provider â†’ Visit â†’ Audio Upload â†’ AI Processing

#### Test S3 Integration
```bash
node test-s3.js
```
Tests: File upload, download, signed URLs, deletion

### 2. Manual API Testing with curl

#### Authentication Flow
```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

### 3. Using Postman or Insomnia

Import the API into Postman/Insomnia for visual testing:

1. Create a new collection called "LumiMD"
2. Set up environment variables:
   - `base_url`: http://localhost:3000/api
   - `access_token`: (save from login response)
3. Add requests organized by feature
4. Use collection variables for IDs

brew install apache-bench

# Test login endpoint
ab -n 100 -c 10 -p login.json -T application/json \
  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login

# Test authenticated endpoint
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile
```

### 6. Error Testing

Test error handling:

```bash
# Invalid credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "wrong@example.com", "password": "wrong"}'

# Missing required fields
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/providers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": ""}'

# Invalid token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token"

# Resource not found
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/visits/nonexistent-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Test Data

The test scripts automatically create test data:
- Test users with unique emails (timestamp-based)
- Sample providers
- Sample medical records
- Sample action items
- Trusted access relationships

## Database Inspection

Check database directly:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U tylermcanally -d lumimd

# View tables
\dt

# Check user count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User";

# Check recent visits
SELECT * FROM "Visit" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5;

# Check audit logs
SELECT * FROM "AuditLog" ORDER BY "timestamp" DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Logs

Check application logs:

```bash
# Server logs are output to console
# In production, check:
tail -f logs/app.log
tail -f logs/error.log
```

## Next Steps

Once all tests pass:
1. âœ… Backend API fully functional
2. âœ… All features tested
3. âœ… Security verified
4. âœ… Ready for mobile development

**You're ready to build the iOS app!** ðŸš€
